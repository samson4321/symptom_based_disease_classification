🩺 Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Symptom-Based Multi-Class Classification
📌 Project Overview

This project investigates whether machine learning models can predict diseases using only:

🧓 Patient age

🚻 Patient gender

📝 Self-reported symptoms

The task is formulated as a multi-class classification problem, where each patient is assigned one disease label from many possible diseases.

⚠️ This project does not aim to build a real medical diagnostic system.
Instead, it focuses on understanding the limitations of machine learning when the available data is insufficient.

📂 Dataset Description

Source: Kaggle Healthcare Dataset

Type: Structured tabular data

Target Variable: Disease (many disease classes)

🔹 Input Features

Age — continuous numerical feature

Gender — categorical (one-hot encoded)

Symptoms — text field converted into multiple binary indicators

🔹 Removed Columns

Patient_ID — identifier only, no predictive value

Symptom_Count — redundant after symptom encoding

🔄 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The following preprocessing steps were applied carefully to ensure correctness and consistency.

1️⃣ Age Scaling

Age was scaled to [0, 1] using MinMaxScaler

Prevents age from dominating distance calculations in KNN

2️⃣ Gender Encoding

Converted into:

Gender_Female

Gender_Male

Gender_Other

Boolean values converted to 0 / 1

Gender features were not scaled

3️⃣ Symptom Encoding

The Symptoms text column (comma-separated symptoms) was:

Split into individual symptoms

Converted into binary (0/1) one-hot features

Original text column removed

4️⃣ Train-Test Split

75% training / 25% testing

Stratified split used to preserve disease distribution

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
🔹 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Distance-based classifier

Tested with multiple values of k

Training vs test accuracy plotted to analyze overfitting

🔹 Random Forest Classifier

Ensemble-based model

Used as a baseline comparison

Confirms whether low accuracy is model-specific or data-related

📊 Evaluation & Visual Analysis
1️⃣ Class Distribution Analysis

Disease frequencies were examined using:

Raw counts

Percentages

Visualizations:

🟠 Pie chart — overall proportions

🔵 Bar chart — clearer comparison with many classes

Result:

Classes are roughly balanced, so class imbalance is NOT the main issue.

2️⃣ Training vs Test Accuracy Curve (KNN)

A graph was generated showing:

Training accuracy vs number of neighbors (k)

Test accuracy vs number of neighbors (k)

Observed Behavior

k = 1 → training accuracy ≈ 100% (memorization)

Training accuracy decreases as k increases

Test accuracy remains very low for all k values

Interpretation

Small k → overfitting

Large k → underfitting

No value of k leads to good generalization

📈 Final Results
🔹 Model Accuracy Summary
Model	Accuracy
KNN (best k)	~3–4%
Random Forest	~3%
🔹 Classification Report

Precision, recall, and F1-scores are very low across all diseases

No disease class is predicted reliably

Performance is close to random guessing

🧪 Interpretation of Results

The low accuracy is not caused by a bug, poor preprocessing, or incorrect model usage.

Instead, it reflects fundamental limitations of the dataset.

Key Reasons for Poor Performance

🔴 Large number of disease classes

🔴 Strong symptom overlap between diseases

🔴 Sparse, high-dimensional feature space

🔴 Lack of clinical depth:

No lab tests

No severity indicators

No medical history

No temporal information

📌 Key Conclusion

Symptoms alone are insufficient to reliably distinguish between many diseases.

❗ Important Insight

This project demonstrates an important machine learning principle:

Low accuracy does not always mean a bad model — it can mean insufficient information.

Understanding why a model fails is just as important as achieving high accuracy.

🚀 Possible Improvements (Future Work)
🔧 Data Improvements

Group diseases into broader categories (e.g., respiratory, neurological)

Remove very rare symptoms

Add clinical features (lab results, vitals, severity)

🤖 Modeling Improvements

Hierarchical classification

Gradient boosting models

Feature selection or dimensionality reduction

📈 Evaluation Improvements

Top-k accuracy (e.g., is the correct disease in the top 5 predictions?)

Confusion matrix analysis for systematic misclassifications
